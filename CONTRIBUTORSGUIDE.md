# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE ON CLEMENS

Contributing is easy, just follow these steps:

If you want to read an actual article, read [this](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github).
1) First, fork the repository. Press the fork fork button in the upper left of the website. This will "clone" the repository into a repo made for you, so that you can edit it whoever you want!
2) Clone It! You cannot edit it online, so use `git clone github.com/USERNAME/clemens`. You have to replace the USERNAME with your own github username.
3) Now you have it locally. You can now edit the code and contribute everything that you would like.
4) Push everything to your branch often, if you do not know how to do this, follow [this](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line) guide.
5) Create a pull request by following [this article](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github) (The last step) Please remember this rule:
    * Please describe what you did and why this should be in the project
6) Wait until your request is either approved or declined.

If you follow these steps, nothing can stop you (Except merge incapabilities, errors, oh wow, now that I think about it there is a lot that could stop you)

#### Thank you for even considering a contribution, every contribution, no matter how small, matters and helps to make the project the best that it can be.
